# Wave Software Development Challenge - Rad Wojcik

Please review my submission. In my case, I kept it pretty simple and clean. I kept the front-end vanilla, as I would
figure out what the client wants here in terms of the UX. Since there were no functional requirements here I left it
without any customization so I wouldn't have to re-do any work later. I would like to show case this as a strength,
following exact direction, no more no less.  The requirements that were gathered, were written in a very logical and
clean manner while keeping it simple.  The choice was mde to create a 1-1 relationship between employee and user.
The project was split into two apps, employees and expenses, which might scale better as the code grows. I am proud
of the fact that I could turn over my code to another developer, and they wouldn't have any problems figuring out how
it works in very little time.
